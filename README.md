# Circuit Solver and Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing various circuit solving techniques and optimization algorithms implemented using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Cython, NetworkX, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Project Highlights

- **Circuit Solver using Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)**: Implemented a Circuit Solver using the Modified Nodal Analysis matrix method. It utilizes NumPy for efficient matrix operations and Gaussian elimination for solving the resulting linear equations. Cython was used to optimize the execution speed, providing significant performance improvements.

- **Combinational Digital Circuits Solver**: Created a solver for combinational digital circuits using NetworkX library. The solver employs the Topological sort algorithm and an event-driven approach to simulate the circuits and determine the output values.

- **Non-linear Curve Fitting with FFT and SciPy**: Utilized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and SciPy library to perform non-linear curve fitting on complex noise-mixed functions. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in accurately fitting curves to noisy data.

- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implemented various optimization algorithms, including Simulated Annealing for solving the NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), animated polygon morphing using Matplotlib, and rendered the path of Gradient Descent for 3D functions using Mpltoolkits.
